# CONTEXT.md - orsted/commands

## What is this folder
Contains slash command definitions for the Orsted plugin. These are markdown files that define commands users can invoke in Claude Code.

## Work Log

### 2026-01-15
- **Added `status.md` command**: Created a new `/status` slash command to help with plugin recognition. This provides users a way to check if Orsted is active and understand what it does.

## What Failed
- Nothing specific failed in this folder, but the command was added as part of improving overall plugin recognition by the marketplace system.

## Decisions
- **Simple informational command**: Chose to make `/status` a simple informational response rather than a complex diagnostic tool. The goal was plugin recognition, not functionality.
- **Content focus**: Emphasized what Orsted does (CONTEXT.md updates) and where to look (project folders) to help users understand the plugin's value.

## Status
🟢 Done
